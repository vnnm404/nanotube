# NanoTube

In this project, we sought out to build a simple streaming platform that was easy to understand. Our system **NanoTube** consists of a single server-multiple client structure, where the server interacts with multiple data store servers. Using concepts from distributed systems, our system can recover from server crashes and is fault-tolerant up to an entire data store crash. If several data stores crash, our system is still available with high probability. We also ensure that the load is balanced across all data stores and report several metrics to monitor the functioning of our system.
